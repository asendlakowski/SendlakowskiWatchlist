	<h2>Questions:</h2>

	<p>I selected an API that guesses the users age based on their name, it outputs the inputted name, the guessed age and the corresponding birth year</p>
	<p>I found this API on a list on https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/ and the api itself comes from Agify.io</p>
	<p>I inputted my name of "Alana" into the API and accessed and printed the guessed age and then birth year based on that guess.</p>
	<p>This API could be used in a website or game that randomly generates a character based on the name (in order to get a ballpark of the age of a person). Could be used in a website that generates statistics about name popularity based on generations</p>
